# Workflow: script → beats → frames

## 1. Break the script into beats
Read the script once for the story, then once for pictures. Every sentence usually holds something to show: a subject, an action, a change, a comparison, a number, a payoff. Write a beat list before any code:

| # | start-end (s) | words | what we see | camera | transition out |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

- Timing: with a voiceover, the audio length wins (measure it, never speed it up). Without one, about 150 words a minute plus short pauses after big lines.
- A beat lasts as long as its idea needs, usually 2-5 s. A punchline can be 1 s; a process may need 6.
- The first beat must show the subject or the most interesting moment at once. No logos or slow fades at the start.
- If a beat only decorates, replace it with one that explains or entertains.

## 2. Decide the cast and the world (continuity sheet)
Write down, once, how each recurring thing looks: silhouette, colours, size relative to others, clothing or markings, the light direction, the typeface. Reuse those exact values in every beat. A character never changes look unless the story says so.

## 3. Draw it in the style's own language
Open the style file and translate every beat into that medium: pixels for Pixel Art, chalk strokes for Chalkboard, dotted light for Glow Sketch, and so on. Everything in the frame (people, sky, ground, text, effects) follows the style, not only the hero object.

## 4. Build the file
Start from `player-template.html`:
- Put all drawing in `draw(t)` where `t` is seconds. It must give the same picture for the same `t` every time, in any order (no `Math.random()` at draw time, no clocks, no `requestAnimationFrame` inside `draw`). Use the template's seeded `rand()` and precompute random layouts once.
- Set `CONFIG` (width, height, fps, duration, background).
- 2D styles: draw on the main canvas. 3D styles: render three.js into the template's WebGL canvas, then copy it onto the main canvas (this is also where PS2's low-res look and any overlays happen).
- Load fonts and textures before setting `window.ready = true`.
- Plan motion with easing: things accelerate and settle; nothing moves at constant speed unless it's travelling.

## 5. Look before you hand over
Open the file, scrub through it, and look at the first frame, every beat change and the last frame. Fix anything from `checklist.md` that fails. Then export (Export button, or `scripts/render.mjs` when available) and check the result plays, has the right size and length, and includes the audio if there was any.

## 6. Audio and captions
- Use only audio the user gives you or creates. Don't invent music or voice.
- Captions only when asked: a few words at a time, from the real script, inside the safe area, styled to fit the look.
- Labels that belong to the picture (a sign, a diagram arrow, a comic sound word) are part of the art, not captions.

## 7. Edits later
Keep the beat list at the top of the HTML in a comment. When the user asks for a change, change that beat only and leave the rest as it was.
